Summary of Work:
- Implemented four sections from the provided Figma design:
  1. Hero Section: Features floating logos on the left and right with centered text and a call-to-action button.
  2. AI Section: Includes text with a button and overlapping images, styled with a gradient background.
  3. Rating Section: Displays a slider with text and a background wave image.
  4. Journey Section: A call-to-action section with centered text and background images.
- Used HTML for structure, ensuring clean and semantic markup with proper alt attributes for accessibility.
- Styled the website using CSS (styles.css), focusing on accuracy in replicating the Figma design, including fonts (DM Sans), colors, spacing, and responsive behavior for tablets, mobile devices, and small screens.
- Added JavaScript (script.js) to implement a fade-in animation for sections using the Intersection Observer API.
- Created a Dockerfile to set up an Nginx container:
  - Exposes port 80 in the container and maps it to port 3000 on the host.
  - Configured a volume to sync the websiteâ€™s public files (run command: docker run -d -p 3000:80 -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html eight25-internship).
- Provided an Nginx configuration (nginx.conf) for the domain http://eight25-internship-assessment.test.
- Included virtual host configurations for both Apache and Nginx in this summary.
