Internship Assignment (FE) - Rashmi Jayawardhana

Summary of Work:
- Implemented four sections from the provided Figma design:
  1. Hero Section: Features floating logos on the left and right with centered text and a call-to-action button.
  2. AI Section: Includes text with a button and overlapping images, styled with a gradient background.
  3. Rating Section: Displays a slider with text and a background wave image.
  4. Journey Section: A call-to-action section with centered text and background images.
- Used HTML for structure, ensuring clean and semantic markup with proper alt attributes for accessibility.
- Styled the website using CSS (styles.css), focusing on accuracy in replicating the Figma design, including fonts (DM Sans), colors, spacing, and responsive behavior for tablets (1024px), mobile devices (768px), and small screens (544px).
- Added JavaScript (script.js) to implement a fade-in animation for sections using the Intersection Observer API.
- Created a Dockerfile to set up an Nginx container:
  - Exposes port 80 in the container and maps it to port 3000 on the host.
  - Configured a volume to sync the websiteâ€™s public files.
- Provided an Nginx configuration (nginx.conf) for the domain http://eight25-internship-assessment.test.
- Included virtual host configurations for both Apache and Nginx below.

Live Version:

- Alternatively, it can be viewed locally by running the Docker container:
  - Command (Unix): docker run -d -p 3000:80 -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html eight25-internship
  - Command (Windows): docker run -d -p 3000:80 -v C:/path/to/project:/usr/share/nginx/html eight25-internship
  - Access at: http://localhost:3000

Virtual Host Configurations (Windows):

Apache Configuration (C:\Apache24\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf):
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName eight25-internship-assessment.test
    ServerAlias www.eight25-internship-assessment.test
    DocumentRoot "C:/webroot/eight25-internship-assessment"
    <Directory "C:/webroot/eight25-internship-assessment">
        Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
    ErrorLog "C:/Apache24/logs/eight25-error.log"
    CustomLog "C:/Apache24/logs/eight25-access.log" combined
</VirtualHost>

Nginx Configuration (C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf):
http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;
    sendfile        on;
    keepalive_timeout  65;
    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  eight25-internship-assessment.test;
        location / {
            root   C:/webroot/eight25-internship-assessment;
            index  index.html index.htm;
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
        }
        error_log  C:/nginx/logs/eight25-error.log;
        access_log C:/nginx/logs/eight25-access.log;
    }
}

Note: If port 80 is in use (e.g., by another service like IIS), you can change the port to 8080 in the configurations above (e.g., <VirtualHost *:8080> for Apache, listen 8080 for Nginx) and access the site at http://eight25-internship-assessment.test:8080.

To test locally on Windows, add to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (run Notepad as Administrator):
